        <h2>Hi, I'm Shirizu ðŸ‘‹</h2>
        <p>I'm a Computer Science student who loves building things for the web. I enjoy working with frontend tools and exploring backend logic through PHP, Python, and Git.</p>
        <p>My focus now is on learning GitHub workflows, building fullstack apps, and preparing for internships in software engineering and machine learning.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy pixel art, game dev experiments, and building little web tools to solve random problems.</p>
